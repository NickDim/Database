# Database

Database is an interactive project I am working on. The database will run from my website at nickdim.me/intDatabase and store people's first names, last names, primary keys and emails. If people choose to enter their emails, I also have a sendgrid client to send emails to everyone in the database, telling them how many people are in the database. This, however will be done rarely and mostly for testing purposes.
