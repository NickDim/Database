# Database [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NickDim/Database.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NickDim/Database)

Database is an interactive project I am working on. The database will run from
[my website](http://nickdim.me/intDatabase.html) and store people's first names,
last names, primary keys and emails. If people choose to enter their emails,
I also have a SendGrid client to send emails to everyone in the database,
telling them how many people are in the database. This, however, will be done
rarely and mostly for testing purposes.
